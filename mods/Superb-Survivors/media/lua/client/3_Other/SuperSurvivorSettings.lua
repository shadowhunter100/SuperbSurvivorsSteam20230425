--- use the options menu in main menu: options are not here anymore!



-- 6/23/2022
-- The settings here have been moved into THE IN GAME SETTINGS 
-- Please do not change the options here because it COULD BREAK YOUR GAME.
-- Except SpeakEnabled, you can change that if you like

-- Update: Don't try to turn gfollowdistance into a variable from what it equals to. I made followtask add what it needs to add on its own.
GFollowDistance = 5
DebugSayEnabled = DebugOptions
SpeakEnabled = true
PVPDefault = Option_ForcePVP
